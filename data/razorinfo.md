The company was surprised to see\nthat the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they\nwent about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the\nlives of businesses simpler and that\'s how Razorpay was born. The company\nwitnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and\nunderstood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve -\ndemocratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved\nmarket, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42\nstartups in India that became unicorns in 2022. Razorpay enables payments and\nbanking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook,\nAirtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension\nScheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato,\nSwiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and\nvalues that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization\npractices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is\non the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-\ngen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will\ncontinue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products\nthat will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive\nfinancial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done,\ntogether, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that\nIndia can build a better place for doing business. Razorpay’s valuation jumped\nfrom $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host\nof marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian\ncompany to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y\nCombinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV,\nGIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners,\nSalesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of\n$741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round\nof Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the\nfastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to\nfurther scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new\nbanking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling\ncompliance, operations and more on growth. This commitment to make lives\nsimpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to\nmake acquisitions with like-minded companies. In total, till date, Razorpay\nhas made seven acquisitions over the course of time: Acquired Ezetap in 2022 -\nIndia’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading\nfintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment\nnetworks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-\nenabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international\nforay in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A\nRecurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform\nthat facilitates digital financing solutions. RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a\nPayroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation\nof a business’s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning\nfor real-time fraud prevention. Customer has always been at the core of all\ndisruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering\nnew solutions: \\- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several Industry\nfirst innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to\nlaunch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch\nsupport for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce\nrecurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment\nreceipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless\nand optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts\ninclude: \\- First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution,\nTokenHQ \\- Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit\ncards on UPI \\- Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment\ngateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline\nPOS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline\npayments experience. \\- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include\nLGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the\nfirst Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly\ninclusive insurance policy for its team members.

(i.e., How did the founders meet? How\ndid you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)\n\nHarshil and Shashank met in IIT Roorkee and collaborated together on a number\nof projects during the course of their college days. Both the co-founders are\ncoders themselves and have written a lot of codes on which Razorpay runs\ntoday. They were also the founding members of SDS Labs, the software\ndevelopment section of IIT Roorkee. After they graduated from college,\nShashank moved to the USA to work with Microsoft while Harshil went on to work\nwith Schlumberger in the Middle east. Having been good friends since college,\nthey stayed in touch and worked on a bunch of side projects. One such side\nproject was in 2014, where they were building a crowdsourcing platform to\ncollect online donations for a cause, they contacted a few payment gateway\ncompanies, and were surprised to see that the simple process of accepting\npayments was not streamlined. Having faced bad experiences, **Harshil and\nShashank understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve\n- the democratization of payments for Indian businesses, particularly the\nunderserved market - the SMEs** so they decided to solve the problems around\npayments and provide a simple, affordable and secure way for startups, SME’s\nand organizations like schools, colleges and training centers to accept online\npayments. Armed with research and a zeal to build a platform dedicated to\nstartups and their payment needs, that’s how Razorpay was founded. **For both\nfounders, it’s the attitude of perseverance. And it’s the same trait that is a\nlifestyle for the Razorpay team. It’s the burning desire to identify problems\nsmall businesses are facing around money movement** & they love tinkering with\ntechnology to solve those. When the founders and team know there is an\nexisting problem that needs to be solved, they persevere through it until\nthey’ve found a solution, come rain or shine. It’s this trait that made\n**Razorpay grow from 10,000 partner businesses in 2017 to over 10 Mn today.**\n\n#### What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What\nmade you decide to work on it?\n\nIn 2014, after discovering the dismal state of online payments in India\nHarshil and Shashank founded Razorpay, **India’s first payment gateway built\nfor Startups** a platform for a simple, affordable, and secure way for\nbusinesses to accept payments online. Progressing in the journey that started\nwith payment acceptance, the company also witnessed a progressive acceptance\nand adoption of digital innovations. But what was surprising was while the big\npayment players in the market were catering to large businesses, smaller\nbusinesses needed immediate attention. In India, **MSMEs are the second\nlargest employment-generating sector after agriculture and contribute around\n31% to the nation’s GDP**. One of the major challenges for SMEs & Startups was\nthe lack of technology infrastructure, especially for B2B payment\ntechnologies. There was a need for a comprehensive converged payment and\nbanking solution that can help manage the entire money movement (from\nacceptance to disbursals) within an organisation. This particular thought gave\nbirth to the launch of **Razorpay’s neo-banking platform, RazorpayX, and\nlending platform Razorpay Capital.** The company now offers a single platform\nfor businesses to manage the entire money flow within an organization. Eight\nyears to now, **Razorpay evolved from being a payment gateway to India’s first\nfull-stack financial solutions company providing intelligent new-age payment\nand business banking solutions** to help Indian businesses address the entire\nlength and breadth of their payment & banking journey. The company believes\nthat for the next phase of growth in the fintech industry, payment players\nneed to **evolve beyond offering solutions for payment acceptance to managing\nthe entire money flow (from acceptance to disbursements and everything in\nbetween). Hence, it is of supreme importance to recognize a market (SMEs &\nStartups)**, identify challenges, and provide a holistic solution, at scale.\n\n#### What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be\ndifferent about the world?\n\n **Razorpay is committed to building the central nervous system of digital\nIndia.** The company aims to change how payments and banking are done for\nsmall businesses in India and wants to create a benchmark for the entire world\nto follow. Razorpay today is India’s leading and first full-stack financial\nsolutions company that offers both payments and banking solutions for\nbusinesses on a single platform. The founding team always wanted to build a\nplatform like this because of the single goal **\\- to help businesses spend\nless time managing compliance and operations and more time creating new\nproducts, pursuing new ideas, and thinking about how to scale. The company’s\nvision continues to produce new idea and innovation that benefits millions of\nbusinesses even today.** Overall, the company wants to help make India\neconomically more inclusive and is making strides toward that goal. Razorpay\nbelieves It’s an exciting time of change and is creating history. Digitization\nis the lifeblood of any business. It impacts EVERYTHING a business does - from\ncash flow & hiring to credit, investment & expansion. Businesses can no longer\nthink of digitization as an afterthought! The digital payments landscape has\nmultiplied over the last decade. India has globally positioned itself as a\nbenchmark in digital payments owing to its resilient payment infrastructure,\nmarket practices, and proliferation of digital payments across various\nsegments. The adoption of digital payments in the MSME space has unlocked\nseveral efficiencies that have driven end-to-end transformation in how small\nbusinesses conduct their operations. **India today is amongst the fastest\ngrowing Fintech markets in the world** , being the 3rd largest FinTech\necosystem, India has the highest Fintech adoption rate globally (87%).\n**Razorpay also believes & foresees Indian fintech as the default service\nprovider for the world that can make a difference by bringing customized\ndigital solutions for customers beyond the geographies clubbed with best-in-\nclass fintech technologies.**\n\n'
